[ Verse 1 ]
Let the weak say, "I am strong"
Let the poor say, "I am rich"
Let the blind say, "I can see"
It's what the Lord has done in me

[ Chorus ]
Hosanna, Hosanna
To the Lamb that was slain
Hosanna, Hosanna
Jesus died and rose again

[ Verse 2 ]
Into the river, I will wade
There my sins are washed away
From the heavens mercy streams
Of the Savior's love for me

[ Verse 3 ]
I will rise from waters deep
Into the saving arms of God
I will sing salvation songs
Jesus Christ has set me free
