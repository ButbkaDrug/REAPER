He gives us joy when we're sad
Peace when we're mad
And patience when we can't wait
He gives us comfort and strength
And all that we need
Yeah, he gives and gives and gives and gives

[ Chorus ]
Giver of life, Giver of love
All that is good comes from above
This is our God, shining on us
All that is good comes from above

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
