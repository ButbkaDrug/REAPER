[ Verse 1 ]
Man was lost in darkness
Without a light to see
Jesus came with purpose
To set His people free

[ Pre Chorus ]
Now we have hope
Now we have life
All because God
Gave us Christ
Now we have hope
Now we have life
Cause Jesus died

[ Chorus ]
And He rose three days later
The grave couldn't hold Him down
He rose three days later
And death has no power now
Cause He rose

[ Tag ]
He rose

[ Verse 2 ]
The cost of sin is death
There was a price to pay
Jesus came with purpose
He came to take our place

[ Bridge ]
I will lift my hands to the God above
Who saved me in His perfect love
I will lift my hands to the God on high
Who saved me by laying down His life
